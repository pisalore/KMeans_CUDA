# kMeans_CUDA
## A simple implementation of kMeans algorithm based on CUDA

In this repo k-Means in his parallel version is presented. The CUDA technology has been used.
This repo belong to a wider Master Degree Parallel Computing project: the aim is to compare the k-Means in its [sequential and OMP versions](https://github.com/pisalore/kMeans_OMP) with the one implemented using CUDA, here provided.
